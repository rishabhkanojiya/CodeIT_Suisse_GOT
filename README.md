# Battle of Blackwater

The Battle of Blackwater has been the largest battle in the War Of The Five Kings to date. The battle was an attempt by Stannis Baratheon, brother of the late King Robert Baratheon, to take King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, and to seize the Iron Throne from King Joffrey Baratheon. It required a naval assault and an attack on the city gates by land.
